        Hello, I am Zak Gurden, my main interest is in programming, with my current language of choice being C++.
        Why do I enjoy programming? I think a (poorly parathrased) quote of Linus Torvalds sums it up well: <br><br>
        <i>"You can tell a computer what to do and it will just do it."</i>
        <br><br>
        Of course this can also be a somewhat frustrating thing when you assume the computer somehow understands
        what you intend, and you are debugging for an endless amount of time.
        Though sometimes that in of itself is fun in retrospect, or rather the 'end' result is.
        <br> <br>
        In the near future I wish to learn about computer networking and/or other related IT topics. <br>
        I like using Linux as my main OS, and is the one that I have the most technical knowledge in, 
        though I do have experience in casual use of Windows 10 and MacOS. <br>
        My distribution of choice is Arch Linux, though admittedly I have only used Linux mint, a good and friendly distro,
        before switching to mainly use Arch with the help of another enthusiastic friend.
